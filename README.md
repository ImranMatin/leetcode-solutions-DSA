# leetcode-solutions-DSA
Collection of LeetCode problems to practice DSA and ace the coding interview!

Mastering coding interviews through patterns, data structures, and deep understanding
A curated, structured journey to becoming technically strong and interview-ready.

🔍 Why this Repository?
This repo is not just a solution bank. It's a personal roadmap to:

✅ Practic by problem-solving patterns, not just topics.
✅ Improve code quality and Java syntax fluency.
✅ Develop true algorithmic thinking and systemized approaches.
✅ Make revision faster with clean explanations and categorizations.
🧠 Core Problem-Solving Patterns
🧩 Pattern	💡 When to Use
Two Pointers	When scanning from both ends or moving inwards
Sliding Window	Substrings, subarrays, longest/repeating patterns
Prefix Sum / Diff	Range-based queries, cumulative totals
Stack / Monotonic	Previous/next greater elements, parsing expressions
Backtracking	Permutations, combinations, constraint-based paths
Binary Search	Sorted input, finding boundaries, search space
Dynamic Programming	Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
Union Find / DSU	Disjoint components, connectivity problems
🧰 Data Structures Mastered Here.
Structure	Use Cases & Application Areas
Arrays	Sorting, partitioning, searching, prefix-based logic
HashMaps / Sets	Fast lookups, frequency counts, uniqueness checks
Stacks / Queues	Parsing, order retention, monotonic sequences
Linked Lists	Pointer manipulation, reversal, merging
Trees	DFS, BFS, recursion, tree building
Graphs	Topo sort, shortest path, DFS/BFS traversals
Heaps / PriorityQ	Top K problems, streaming data, merging sorted lists
Tries	Prefix-based searching, autocomplete systems
1D/2D DP Arrays	Grid problems, subset sums, palindromes
🧭 Learning Objectives
This repo is optimized for:

📘 Learning Efficiency

Each problem is tied to a common pattern and includes annotated code
Java-specific syntax tricks and best practices explained
🧠 Depth Over Breadth

Instead of covering 1000 problems, we focus on the ones that build intuition
Strategic repetition of concepts in varying problem forms
💼 Interview Readiness

Emphasis on what companies ask most
Strong focus on patterns like Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion, and DP
📚 Study Methodology
